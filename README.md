# Alphabet of Projects
I will do a project for avery letter of the alphabet. 
I am trying to figure out which area of programming I would like to focus on moving forward and so I am going to do a project for every letter in the alphabet. I am going to focus on three areas - Web Development, Machine Learning and Security - as these are the areas that have interested me the most so far in programming. I will do 8 letters per area and leave the remaing two letters as wildcards.
